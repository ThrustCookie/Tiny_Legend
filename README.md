This is a c++ project made in visual studio for windows. It's a small 2d topdown game mimicing zelda. To run it either compile it or run the TinyLegend.exe already provided. Right now it has issues with drawing to the screen due to the limited pixel resolution so i recomend playing only in fullscreen.
